My name is Stanley Sawicz, and I am a recent graduate of Rutger's Business School
with a major in Business Analytics and Information Technology. This repository will
host my personal projects as I use various analytics mediums and tell compelling 
stories through data. Though for now it only contains Tableau Workbooks, I plan to 
include Power BI dashboards, R files, and some Python code, to show I am not just a
one trick pony! Please feel free to view, critique, or take inspiration from my work.
You can also contact me on my LinkedIn to discuss my current projects or suggest ideas
for new ones!
